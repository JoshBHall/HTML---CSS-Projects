			<p><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Sunset is also a very pretty thing to behold.  Currently in Portland we're seeing the sunset at about 9&nbsp;p.m.</span><br>I prefer the sunset most of the time, something about the colors of it combined with that golden hour.<br>Plus it's not <em>so early</em> in the morning!!&copy;</p>
