# Learning HTML & CSS Through Small Projects
 This repository contains my projects created while learning HTML & CSS with a little bit of JavaScript too.  Some of these are extremely basic, like: Let's learn the basic skeleton code needed to create an HTML page.  Others are a little bit of CSS needed to play with fonts and animations so that I could learn bits of information needed for the bigger projects.
 
 ## Projects
 * One Page Website
 * Space Station Site
 * Movie Theater Site
 * Student Portfolio
 
 ## One Page Website
 This site was created with the purpose of learning nesting elements, commenting in HTML, linking images and using anchor tags to shortcut to different sections of the page.
 
 ## Space Station Site
 This is an example home page for a space travel company.  It's styled with CSS containing a navbar, image containers, and a form.
 
 ## Movie Theater Site
 This page is an example home page for a movie theater that's styled using Bootstrap 4.  While creating this site I learned how to use many Bootstrap components such as a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.

## Student Portfolio
Using a template site created by The Tech Academy, I parsed through, removing lines of code to see their effects and gain further understanding.  Then I rewrote all of the code myself for experience and put my personal spin on it.  I now have a functional personal portfolio.
